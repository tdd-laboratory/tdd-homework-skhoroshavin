On the 5th of May every year, Mexicans celebrate Cinco de Mayo. This tradition
began in 1845 (the twenty-second anniversary of the Mexican Revolution), and
is the 1st example of a national independence holiday becoming popular in the
Western Hemisphere. (The Fourth of July didn't see regular celebration in the
US until 15-20 years later.) It is celebrated by 77.9% of the population--
trending toward 80.

    # Bonus! In fact I'm a big fan of yet another approach to tests, which is called property based testing.
    # I've mentioned that a couple of times, but now I see a chance to give a hint at it's power.
    # Main idea is to just come up with some properties (and there are already some patterns exist to help find
    # such properties), possibly write generator function to create valid examples and then throw hundreds
    # of examples at test. There are multiple frameworks for doing this in different languages, an excellent
    # example of such framework for Python is Hypothesis. It already has many generators, as well as many
    # ways to combine these generators into more complex ones. Also when it finds failing case it performs
    # so called "shrinking", which means trying to generate minimal possible example that still fails, which
    # greatly helps in understanding what's wrong. I won't import hypothesis here, you can just
    # Google "Python Hypothesis", there are plenty examples on the internet of how tests look. What I'm going
    # to show there is some crude examples of properties that can greatly reduce amount of tests written.

    # Here we rely on generator that can generate any string. In fact to increase probability
    # of edge cases it would be much better to use some custom written generator that definitely
    # includes valid dates as well as just parts of valid dates. Writing such generator is
    # certainly a time investment, but often it pays off very quick. This is an example of
    # "hard to find easy to verify" property pattern

    # Relying on another generator, which can share a lot of code with previous one.
    # While one could argue that writing generators can introduce more errors, but
    # as with traditional unit tests bugs in tests are actually captured by production
    # code. And vice verse, of course. Also, writing generator is much more simple
    # task than writing a detector (or even parser).
    def property_valid_dates_should_be_detected(self, string_representing_valid_date):
        actual = self.extract_data(string_representing_valid_date, library.dates_iso8601)
        assert len(actual) == 1
        assert actual[0] == string_representing_valid_date

    def property_valid_dates_should_be_found_in_haystack(self, string_containing_valid_dates):
        actual = self.extract_data(any_string, library.dates_iso8601)

    # returns string with separators definitely not in dates, then...

        assert extract_helper(any_string) == extract_helper(extract_helper(any_string))

    # There are many more patterns for properties, like "different paths, same result",
    # "there and back again", "test oracle", "stateful testing" etc. Not all of them are applicable
    # in this small example. Also, in my opinion property based testing doesn't make ordinary
    # "example based testing" obsolete, as examples are very easy for humans to understand and
    # give good starting point. But for finding corner cases I strongly believe property based
    # testing is a way to go. By the way, it's not a new concept, it was first introduced in Haskell
    # by a QuickCheck library, and when in doubt if there is a such framework for your favorite language
    # one can just Google for "quickcheck for <lang>". Hopefully someone will read this...
